# James Huang's website

This is a website for James Huang, an Australian designer who does work ranging from motion to print, and everything in between.

It is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and SCSS.

Mostly everything is static, to the exception of the contact form and the project pages. (WIP)
